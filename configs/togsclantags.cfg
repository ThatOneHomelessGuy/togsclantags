//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// SAMPLE SETUP:
//
//		"Title"											<- This can be anything. I suggest making it something indicating what the setup is for.
//		{
//			"enabled"	"1"								<- Entering "0" here will disable a setup entirely, except as allowable tags for togsclantags_enforcetags = 1 (combo with "exclude" to block that part as well). If omitted, 1 is assumed.
//			"flag"		"INPUT"							<- There are 3 kinds of inputs. See below.
//			"tag"		"[SOME TAG]"					<- Tag.
//			"ignore"	"1"								<- Typically not included. Applies "ignore" setup to client. See below.
//			"exclude"	"1"								<- Either 0 or 1 should be entered here. If omitted, 0 is assumed. If cvar togsclantags_enforcetags = 1, 
//		}												   then "0" includes this tag as an allowed tag when no matching setups are found. "1" excludes the tag from the allowable tags list.
//
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// INPUTS AND ORDER OF OPERATION:
//
// The player will get the first tag that matches them. So, a general order of setups is: Bot setup -> Steam ID setups -> group setups.
//
// BOT: This setup will apply to all bots, and only to bots.
//
// Steam ID (STEAM_X:X:XXXXXXX format): This will apply only to the player whose steam ID it is. 
// 		Note: The plugin checks both "STEAM_0" and "STEAM_1" (steam universe 0 and 1), so if you put the wrong one in, it still works.
//
// Groups: This is a single, multiple, or multiple sets of admin flags.
// 		e.g. Setting the flag as "a" requires players to have the "a" flag to be considered a match.
// 		e.g. "at" requires players to have both the "a" AND "t" flags to be considered a match.
// 		e.g. "a;t" requires players to have either the "a" OR "t" flags to be considered a match.
// 		e.g. "at;b" requires players to have EITHER: (both the "a" AND "t" flags), OR the "b" flag.
// 			If either of the two conditions apply, they are considered a match.
// 		Note: "public" and empty quotes ("") make the access available to all.
//
// "ignore" Setup: When this key-value is included in a setup, you can leave out the "tag" key-value, since it wont be read anyways.
//		The purpose of this key-value is to make exceptions for groups.
//		e.g. PlayerA doesnt want the group tag that is applied to all donators with flag "a".
//		Instead, you could make them a personal setup, using their steam ID as the flag, but with the "ignore" key-value.
//		This setup is read first (assuming you put it above the other one), and they exit the function without a tag.
